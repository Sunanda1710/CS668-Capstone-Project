# Capstone-Project
Problem/Opportunity:

This project gives me an opportunity to address the current pandemic (Covid) situation to simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patientâ€™s lung. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe. With above opportunity the research question I ended up with is:

What would be the predicted airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the breath?

Also, my purpose of this project is to participate in Kaggle open competition and check the competency level.
