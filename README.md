# Capstone-Project
Problem/Opportunity:

This project gives me an opportunity to address the current pandemic (Covid) situation to simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patientâ€™s lung. As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe. With above opportunity the research question I ended up with is:

What would be the predicted airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the breath?

# Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic statistic count is 146,122 cases per million people and there is an incremental trend across the globe.
This project allows me to address this situation and automatically predict the right level flow of air pressure based on the actual pressure values.
As a result, predicting the pressure on ventilation before hand will help in increasing survival rates. The early estimate on recovery rate is 97 to 99.5% 

Also, my purpose of this project is to participate in Kaggle open competition and check the competency level.
